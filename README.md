Website for Atarayo
Website to promote my favourite japanese band, Atarayo. Atarayo (あたらよ) is a band formed in September 2019. Their first original song, 10-Gatsu Mukuchi na Kimi wo Wasureru, went viral primarily on TikTok, launching them to fame. Although the band is more popular now than it used to be before it rose to fame, it is still an underrated band and many people still have not listen to thier music or known about them so the purpose of this website is to allow it to reach more international successs and gain even more popularility and  social pressence.
DESIGN PROCESS
The website showcases the band's popular music videos that they also upload on youtube.
The website is deisgned minimalistically and uses a color palatte similar to google's material you deisgn language.
The website uses a color pallete which comprises of different shades of grey to give off a minimalistic and clean professional look. The theme also goes well with the band's logo which is usally black or white and i played with the different shades of grey to match and contrast the words and the background colors. I used blue for the top footer color to give it a more vibrant look as if i used different shades of grey throughout the whole website it would be too boring or monotonous so a slight addition of color apart from the shades of grey would give it a more aesthetically pleasing look.
FEATURES
Clicking on the Atarayo logo would bring the user back to the homepage.
On mobile view, the header word icons would collapse into a hamburger button would can be opened and closed and hovering over the header icons a grey line would appear under the chosen one to add some interactiveness into the clicking on the buttons. The social media buttons in the footer of every page are all clickable and would bring the user to the band's social media pages such as instagram, twitter, youtube and tiktok where the user would be able to find out more about the band and thier new tracks and thier personal profile or any upcoming events.The goods button in the header is clickable and would redirect the user to the band's website which sells thier official merchandise
